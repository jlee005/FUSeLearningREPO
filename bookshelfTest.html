        <h3>Small Teaching</h3>
        <p>From the review on Amazon: In Small Teaching, James Lang presents a strategy for improving student learning with a series of modest but powerful changes that make a big difference—many of which can be put into practice in a single class period. These strategies are designed to bridge the chasm between primary research and the classroom environment in a way that can be implemented by any faculty in any discipline, and even integrated into pre-existing teaching techniques. Learn, for example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How does one become good at retrieving knowledge from memory?</li>
            <li>How does making predictions now help us learn in the future?</li>
            <li>How do instructors instill fixed or growth mindsets in their students?</li>
            <p>Each chapter introduces a basic concept in cognitive theory, explains when and how it should be employed, and provides firm examples of how the intervention has been or could be used in a variety of disciplines. Small teaching techniques include brief classroom or online learning activities, one-time interventions, and small modifications in course design or communication with students.</p>

        <h3>Make it Stick: The Science of Successful Learning</h3>
        <p>FUN FUN book with entertaining, but pertinent examples from diverse fields—I think the research in this book influenced Lang’s book, Small Teaching.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Review From Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1505842996&sr=8-1&keywords=Make+it+stick
            </li>
            <li>To most of us, learning something "the hard way" implies wasted time and effort. Good teaching, we believe, should be creatively tailored to the different learning styles of students and should use strategies that make learning easier. Make It Stick turns fashionable ideas like these on their head. Drawing on recent discoveries in cognitive psychology and other disciplines, the authors offer concrete techniques for becoming more productive learners.
            </li>
            <li>
                Memory plays a central role in our ability to carry out complex cognitive tasks, such as applying knowledge to problems never before encountered and drawing inferences from facts already known. New insights into how memory is encoded, consolidated, and later retrieved have led to a better understanding of how we learn. Grappling with the impediments that make learning challenging leads both to more complex mastery and better retention of what was learned.
            </li>
            <li>
                Many common study habits and practice routines turn out to be counterproductive. Underlining and highlighting, rereading, cramming, and single-minded repetition of new skills create the illusion of mastery, but gains fade quickly. More complex and durable learning come from self-testing, introducing certain difficulties in practice, waiting to re-study new material until a little forgetting has set in, and interleaving the practice of one skill or topic with another. Speaking most urgently to students, teachers, trainers, and athletes, Make It Stick will appeal to all those interested in the challenge of lifelong learning and self-improvement.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brown, Roedigger, and McDaniel organize and illustrate the 8 chapters in this concise and well written book around the following principal claims about learning. I hope this list entices you to read this captivating book.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Learning is deeper and more durable when it’s effortful.</li>
            <li>We are poor judges of when we are learning well and when we’re not. When the going is harder and slower and it doesn’t feel productive, we are drawn strategies that feel more fruitful, unaware that the gains form these strategies are often temporary.
            </li>
            <li>Rereading text and massed practice of a skill or new knowledge are by far the preferred study strategies of learners, but they are the least productive.</li>
            <li>Retrieval practice—recalling facts of concepts or events from memory is a more effective student strategy than review by rereading. The neural pathways that make up a body of learning do get stronger, when the memory is retrieved and the learning is practiced.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you space out practice at a task and get a little rusty between sessions, you interleave the practice of two or more subjects, retrieval is harder and feels less productive, but the effort produces long lasting learning and enables more versatile applications of it in later settings.
            </li>
            <li>The popular notion that you learn better when you receive instruction in a form consistent with your learning style (auditory or visual learner) is not supported by the empirical research. </li>
            <li>We are susceptible to illusions that can hijack our judgments of what we know and can do. Testing helps calibrate our judgments of what we have learned.
            </li>
            <li>All learning requires a foundation of prior knowledge. 
			</li>
			<li>If you practice elaboration, there’s no known limit of how much you can learn. (Elaboration is the process of giving new material new meaning by expressing it in your own words and connecting it with what you already know. 
			</li>
			<li>Putting new knowledge into a larger context helps learning; ground new knowledge in something concrete that you already know.
			</li>
			<li>People who learn to extract the key ideas from new material and organize them into a mental model and connect that model to prior knowledge show an advantage in learning complex mastery. 
			</li>
			<li>And having a “growth mindset”  allows to become more and more capable.  Failure can be a badge of effort and a source of useful information.  Making mistakes and correcting them build the bridges to advanced learning.
			</li>

			This guide is a treasure trove of examples and advice, which examines the very practical issues of designing and delivering instruction. In this book Feldman and Brent answer the following questions on how to:
			<ul>
			<li>prepare to teach a new course or improve an existing one and get it off to a good start?</li>
			<li>plan and conduct class sessions in which students are actively engaged, no matter how large the class is?</li>
			<li>make good use of technology in face-to-face, online, and hybrid courses and flipped classrooms?</li>
			<li>assess how well students are acquiring the knowledge, skills, and conceptual understanding the course is designed to teach?</li>
			<li>help students develop expert problem-solving skills and skills in communication, creative thinking, critical thinking, high-performance teamwork, and self-directed learning?</li>
			<li>address the learning needs of STEM students with a broad diversity of attributes and backgrounds?</li>
			</ul>

        <h3>Minds Online: Teaching Effectivly with Technology</h3>
        <p>
        	Dr. Michelle Miller helped me navigate the confluence of the scientific understanding of cognition and the rapid spread of educational technology, particularly online instruction.  From this text I could imagine how to redesign an effective hybrid course for freshmen and sophomores enrolled in an introductory course.  Dr. Miller shows how attention, memory, critical thinking, and analytical reasoning can be enhanced through technology-aided approaches. Her emphasis is on the ways in which online teaching tools can actually improve learning for all students.  Chapters include:
        	<ol>
        		<li>Is Online Learning Here to Stay?</li>
        		<li>Online Learning: Does it Work?</li>
        		<li>The Psychology of Computing</li>
        		<li>Attention</li>
        		<li>Memory</li>
        		<li>Thinking</li>
