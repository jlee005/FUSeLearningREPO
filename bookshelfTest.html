        <h3>Small Teaching</h3>
        <p>From the review on Amazon: In Small Teaching, James Lang presents a strategy for improving student learning with a series of modest but powerful changes that make a big difference—many of which can be put into practice in a single class period. These strategies are designed to bridge the chasm between primary research and the classroom environment in a way that can be implemented by any faculty in any discipline, and even integrated into pre-existing teaching techniques. Learn, for example:
            <ul>How does one become good at retrieving knowledge from memory?</ul>
            <ul>How does making predictions now help us learn in the future?</ul>
            <ul>How do instructors instill fixed or growth mindsets in their students?</ul>
            Each chapter introduces a basic concept in cognitive theory, explains when and how it should be employed, and provides firm examples of how the intervention has been or could be used in a variety of disciplines. Small teaching techniques include brief classroom or online learning activities, one-time interventions, and small modifications in course design or communication with students.

            Dr. Richard M. Felder is the Hoechst Celanese Professor Emeritus of Chemical Engineering at North Carolina State University. He is coauthor of Teaching and Learning STEM (2016) and Elementary Principles of Chemical Processes (2015). He has contributed over 300 publications to the fields of science and engineering education and chemical process engineering. With his wife and colleague, Dr. Rebecca Brent he regularly offers teaching effectiveness workshops on campuses and at conferences around the world. He has seven spectacular grandkids and an equally spectacular grand niece.

			This guide is a treasure trove of examples and advice, which examines the very practical issues of designing and delivering instruction. In this book Feldman and Brent answer the following questions on how to:
			<ul>
			<li>prepare to teach a new course or improve an existing one and get it off to a good start?</li>
			<li>plan and conduct class sessions in which students are actively engaged, no matter how large the class is?</li>
			<li>make good use of technology in face-to-face, online, and hybrid courses and flipped classrooms?</li>
			<li>assess how well students are acquiring the knowledge, skills, and conceptual understanding the course is designed to teach?</li>
			<li>help students develop expert problem-solving skills and skills in communication, creative thinking, critical thinking, high-performance teamwork, and self-directed learning?</li>
			<li>address the learning needs of STEM students with a broad diversity of attributes and backgrounds?</li>
			</ul>

        <h3>Minds Online: Teaching Effectivly with Technology</h3>
        <p>
        	Dr. Michelle Miller helped me navigate the confluence of the scientific understanding of cognition and the rapid spread of educational technology, particularly online instruction.  From this text I could imagine how to redesign an effective hybrid course for freshmen and sophomores enrolled in an introductory course.  Dr. Miller shows how attention, memory, critical thinking, and analytical reasoning can be enhanced through technology-aided approaches. Her emphasis is on the ways in which online teaching tools can actually improve learning for all students.  Chapters include:
        	<ol>
        		<li>Is Online Learning Here to Stay?</li>
        		<li>Online Learning: Does it Work?</li>
        		<li>The Psychology of Computing</li>
        		<li>Attention</li>
        		<li>Memory</li>
        		<li>Thinking</li>
        		<li>Incorporating Multimedia Effectively</li>
        		<li>Putting It All Together</li>
